# Introduction
#### Mobile App for Attendance Tracking and Maintenance
AttenDee is a mobile application developed to keep track of the number of people who attended any event or function and their basic information. The user of this system can enter the main details of the relevant event and add the attendees covering the event. This information can be updated or deleted. Existing details can be viewed, and new details can be added. The main advantage of this app is, having a systematic program to maintain the attendance in any event whether it is a course of study or a place of employment. And the user friendliness comes in handy and since it is a mobile application the users have easy access anywhere, anytime. This application has two main components, namely event and attendance. Once an event is entered the users can enter the information relevant to all the participants for that event.
